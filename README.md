# Easy deployment for DSE
The goal here is to create a simple GUI to deploy DSE. This will make it stupid-simple to get DSE up and running for first-time users. We don't want users to have to edit any YAML files. Just ask simple intuitive questions and get up and running

# How it will work
* Scipt will install OpsCenter
* Once OpsCenter is installed, a GUI webpage will load that will ask the user a series of questions
* Based on those answers, the GUI will then work with the LCM API to setup a cluster

# Requirements
* TBD

# Questions to ask
* TBD

# Next steps
* Build out requirements
